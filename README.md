## Notes:
__Run the program in console__
__You Need the help.txt and the config.bpm in the same directory as the executable__

## Want More languages?
__The nice thing about Better Project Manager is the config.bpm can be customized to <br /> the users needs. The way you do that is by adding a new line in the config.bpm file,<br />and writing__ ```KEY=directory_to_folder ``__. The key must be in caps as that is what the <br /> program is looking for. The directory is a folder, the program copies the contents<br /> of that folder and places it in the current working directory.__

## What's next?
__I plan to add an add command to add a language and a find command both of which<br/>will becoming soon.__
